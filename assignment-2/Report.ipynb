    "Take a look at theHelsinki Region Infoshare database at http://www.hri.fi/en/.  From there, download one of the open data sets and visualize some interesting phenomena in the data.  Write a short (2–3 pages)report that describes your approach, obtained results, and the methods you used.  Explore at least threeof the topics discussed in the course (see below) and explain in your report how you have used them.The purpose is not to do an analysis that covers the data from all possible angles.  Focus on one or twoaspects and make a clear visualisation of them.  Try to relate your work to the topics discussed in thecourse, i.e., Tufte’s principles, pre-attentive features, Gestalt laws, etc., when preparing the visualisations.Also, make sure your images convey at least some of their information when printed on a black and whitelaser printer.The use of available visualisation tools (e.g., R, Matlab, Illustrator, (Open)Office, etc.)  is encouraged.\n",
    "However, implementing your own scripts and small programs for processing the data will be necessary."
